# Proposal5A-BearcatE
Bearcat Events is a progresive web application which consists of a list of events that are being organized at Northwest Missouri State University and Maryville. It displays one random event from the list of events on the home screen everyday. It displays a picture, venue details, date and time of the event. The admin is authorized to login to the application and manipulate the data about upcoming events.   
This proposal is in response to the [RFP](https://github.com/pramod096/Bearcat-Events/blob/main/RFP.md).
